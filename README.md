**A Comprehensive Real-World Java Vulnerability Benchmark for Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools Evaluation**

## Overview

This repository contains a **real-world Java vulnerability benchmark** comprising **165 unique CVEs** across popular Java open-source projects. Our benchmark is designed for comprehensive evaluation and comparison of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, providing researchers and practitioners with a standardized dataset for vulnerability detection research.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> [!NOTE]
> **Current Status**: We currently provide **112 verified download URLs** out of 165 total CVEs. We are actively working to complete all 165 URLs and will update the database soon. Stay tuned for the complete dataset!

For your convenience, we provide a **ready-to-use download database** that allows you to quickly obtain all vulnerability data:

### Option 1: Direct Download (Recommended)
```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install pandas requests

# Run the download script
python3 download_vulnerabilities.py
```

The script will:
- ✅ Read all 112 verified URLs from `java_cve_verified_download_urls.csv`
- ✅ Download JAR files to `final_downloads/` directory
- ✅ Show progress and handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Skip already downloaded files

### Option 2: Manual Selection
Browse `java_cve_verified_download_urls.csv` to select specific projects and versions for your research needs.

abstract = {Static application security testing (SAST) takes a significant role in the software development life cycle (SDLC). However, it is challenging to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of SAST tools to determine which is the better one for detecting vulnerabilities. In this paper, based on well-defined criteria, we first selected seven free or open-source SAST tools from 161 existing tools for further evaluation. Owing to the synthetic and newly-constructed real-world benchmarks, we evaluated and compared these SAST tools from different and comprehensive perspectives such as effectiveness, consistency, and performance. While SAST tools perform well on synthetic benchmarks, our results indicate that only 12.7\% of real-world vulnerabilities can be detected by the selected tools. Even combining the detection capability of all tools, most vulnerabilities (70.9\%) remain undetected, especially those beyond resource control and insufficiently neutralized input/output vulnerabilities. The fact is that although they have already built the corresponding detecting rules and integrated them into their capabilities, the detection result still did not meet the expectations. All useful findings unveiled in our comprehensive study indeed help to provide guidance on tool development, improvement, evaluation, and selection for developers, researchers, and potential users.},
